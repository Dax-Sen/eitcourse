## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

# Heading1 Hi All

### Heading 2 Hi Lisbon

There is *nice warm* weather in **Lisbon**. This is a super^script^.

This is an equation: $$q = k * v$$

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
#| echo: true

b <- 2
b
a <- 2
```
